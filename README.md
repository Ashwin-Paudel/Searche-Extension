# Make an extension

  - Create a folder with a random 6 digit number
  - Add two files into the folder ( index.html and index.js )

#### index.html
The index.html is the extension view
> To add css to the html, you need to access it from a url

#### index.js
The index.js is the javascript evaluated by the webView.
> The index.js is the only script evaluated by the webview, so if you want to make a another script, you need to access it from a url

## After that, just upload the file
